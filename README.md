# Practice Vision

This is the code we are using to develop our targeting system.  We are using a pixycam and raspberry pi.  Thus far, we have it working with the simulator and are moving it to the robot as we speak.

The folder labeled Hephestus is the pixy code for the Pi.

The robot.py is based off the practice bot code, but we are going to migrate last-year's competition code in shortly.
